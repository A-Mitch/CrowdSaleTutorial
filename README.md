❗️**IMPORTANT:**
> The program is not working properly so I cannot show you the output.

### 🤔 How to run
You run the code by either:
1. Install the dependencies
```bash
$ npm install
```

2. Run these three commands in succession
```bash
$ truffle compile
$ truffle development
migrate --reset #Once inside the truffle console
```

## 📝 Homework outputs and what happened

1. So there are no outputs 😢. Why? Errors. 🙃
While going through the tutorial I made quite a bit of progress till it came
to actually executing the function to buy tokens. I kept getting the below error:

* ![My Error](./pics/mainError.png)

After several attempts to alleviate the error I was not able to alleviate the problem.
2. So what did I do to try to solve this issue?
* Searched each Error
* Spoke to the professor and friends
* Reworked the solution several times
